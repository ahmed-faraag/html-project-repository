Big data is a field that handles methods of analyzing, systematically extracting information, or dealing with very large or complex data sets that cannot be handled by traditional data-processing application programs. Data that contains multiple states (rows) provides greater statistical strength, while data of higher complexity (more features or columns) may lead to a higher false detection rate. Big data challenges include data capture, data storage, data analysis, research, sharing, transfer, visualization, query, update, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three main concepts: size, diversity, and speed. When we deal with big data, we may not take a sample but observe and track what happens. Therefore, big data often includes data in volumes that exceeds the ability of traditional programs to process at an acceptable time and value.

Current use of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analyzes, or some other advanced data analytics method that extracts value from data, and rarely reaches a specific size from the data set. "There is little doubt that the amounts of data now available are really large, but these are not the most relevant characteristics of this new environmental data system." Dataset analysis can find new connections for "identifying business trends, preventing diseases, fighting crime, etc." Scientists, business managers, medical practitioners, advertising, and governments alike face systemic difficulties with big data sets in areas including Internet research, financial technology, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists face limitations in the work of electronic science, including meteorology, genomics, coupling, simulation of complex physics, biology, and environmental research.
