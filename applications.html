Big data increased the demand for information management professionals to the extent that AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP and Dell software spent more than $ 15 billion on software companies specializing in data management and analysis. In 2010, the industry was worth more than $ 100 billion and was growing at about 10 percent annually: about twice the speed of the software business as a whole.
Developed economies are increasingly using data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6 billion cellphone subscriptions around the world, and between 1 billion and 2 billion people use the Internet. Between 1990 and 2005, more than a billion people worldwide entered the middle class, meaning more people became literate, which in turn led to the growth of information. Effective global capacity to exchange information through telecommunications networks reached 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000 and 65 exabytes in 2007 and forecasts predicted that Internet traffic would reach 667 bytes by 2014. According to one estimate, a third of the information Worldwide stored are in the form of alphanumeric text and static image data, which is the most useful format for most big data applications. This also shows the capabilities of the data not yet used (i.e. video and audio).
While many vendors offer ready-made solutions for big data, experts recommend developing internal solutions specifically designed to solve the company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities.
