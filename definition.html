The term has been in use since the 1990s, with John Machi giving some credit for promoting the term. Big data typically includes data sets of volumes that exceed the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, organize, manage and process data within an acceptable time period. The big data philosophy includes unstructured, semi-structured, and structural data, but the main focus is on unstructured data. Big data is a constantly moving target, starting in 2012 that ranges from a few dozen terabytes to many data. Big data requires a suite of technologies and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from the diverse, complex and massive data sets.
