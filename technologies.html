The McKinsey Global Institute Report 2011 describes the major components and ecosystem of big data as follows:
Techniques for data analysis, such as a / b testing, machine learning and natural language processing
Big data technologies, such as business intelligence, cloud computing, and databases
Visualization, such as graphs, graphs and other data displays
Multidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP cubes or mathematics. Array Database Systems is designed to provide high-level storage and query support for this type of data. Additional technologies that are applied to big data include effective tension-based computing, such as learning in multi-line subspace. , Distributed cache (for example, stream cache and Memcached), distributed databases, cloud-based infrastructure, HPC (applications, storage and computing resources) and the Internet. Although many methods and techniques have been developed, it is still difficult to implement machine learning with big data.
Some relational MPP databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit in this is the ability to upload, monitor, back up and improve the Dynamic Database Management System (RDBMS) data.
DARPA's topographic data analysis program seeks the basic structure of big data sets, and in 2008 the technology became publicly available.
Big data analysts are usually hostile to slow shared storage, preferring direct-access storage (DAS) in its various forms from a solid-state drive (SSD) to a high-capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. Shared storage structures - Storage Area Network (SAN) and Network Associated Storage (NAS) - are slow, complex, and relatively expensive. These characteristics are incompatible with big data analysis systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost.
One of the hallmarks of big data analytics is real-time or near-real-time submission. Thus, latency is avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in well-attached memory or disk - Data on memory or disk at the other end of the FC SAN connection is not. The cost of SAN storage on the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage technologies.

There are advantages and disadvantages of shared storage in big data analytics, but big data analytics practitioners as of 2011 didn't like it.
